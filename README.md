# I3E-Assignment-2
Repository for I3E assignment 2
This is the assignment 2 for STLD and I3E.
The game is First-person/Open-world, taking about 20/30 minutes to play, uses a PC platform, and is geared towards teens and young adults. 
It has the navigation in the main menu, audio shifting, soundtrack playing when certain events/actions happen, about 3-5 different levels to navigate around main structure, mechanic to send objects to inventory on button press, 5 different parts to collect spread around the levels, events that are triggered, and first person perspective.
There are 5 levels which wouldnâ€™t be too hard as the main aspect is navigation. 
You play as a space explorer, flying through the universe and going on adventures on different planets.
After a narrow escape, your damaged ship crashes onto a rocky strange planet.
With the engine shattering apart and leaving you stranded, you awake in a rocky plain leading into a giant cave with 5 levels as it gets deeper inside. 
From there, you have to go into the cave and progress through each of the levels to retrieve a missing engine part/fuel rod to assemble your engine back and escape.
